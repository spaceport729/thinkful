### 1. Do people watch more videos after converting from unpaid to paid membership?

# create table with total view counts by subscription, join on subquery that limits to customers with more than one subscription -
# with the older subscription unpaid and the new subscription paid

WITH
    video_counts
AS (
    SELECT
            Views.customer_id AS customer_id,
            subs_2.is_paid AS is_paid,
            COUNT(*) AS total_videos_viewed
    FROM 
            Views
    JOIN
            (SELECT
                customer_id
                start_date,
                end_date,
                is_paid
                RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, ORDER BY end_date ASC) AS rank
             FROM
                subscriptions
             GROUP BY 
                customer_id,
                start_date,
                end_date,
                rank
                is_paid
             HAVING 
                COUNT(customer_id) = 2 AND ((is_paid = 'yes' AND rank = 2) OR (is_paid = 'no' AND rank = 1))
                ) AS subs_2
    ON
            Views.start_at BETWEEN subs_2.start_date AND subs_2.end_date
    WHERE
            Views.customer_id = Subscriptions.customer_id 
            
    GROUP BY
            Views.customer_id, subs_2.is_paid
)


# Output average number of videos viewed between the two subscription types
SELECT 
    is_paid
    AVG(total_videos_viewed)
FROM
    video_counts
GROUP BY
    is_paid



### 2. Do paid users prefer different genres of videos than unpaid users?
    (returning the rank of each genre and view counts within each subscription type)
   SELECT
       views.genre
       subscriptions.is_paid
       COUNT(views.genre)
       RANK() OVER(BY PARTITION subscriptions.is_paid, ORDER BY COUNT(views.genre) DESC) AS rank
   FROM
       views
   JOIN
       subscriptions
   ON
       views.start_at BETWEEN subscriptions.start_date AND subscriptions.end_date
   WHERE
       views.customer_id = subscriptions.customer_id
   GROUP BY views.genre, subscriptions.is_paid, rank
   



### 3. What are the most popular videos for our 100 most frequent viewers? What percentage of those users are paid for each video?

# join views and customers to get subscription status (based on date) and limit top customers by rank
  WITH 
    top_customer_videos 
  AS (
    SELECT
        views.customer_id AS customer_id, 
        views.video_name AS video_name,
        subscriptions.is_paid AS is_paid,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(views.customer_id) DESC) AS rank
    FROM
        views
    JOIN
        subscriptions
    ON
       views.start_at BETWEEN subscriptions.start_date AND subscriptions.end_date 
    WHERE
        rank <= 100 AND Views.customer_id = Subscriptions.customer_id
        )
      
 # return top 20 videos and percentage value of paid subscriptions
 
 SELECT
    video_name,
    ROUND(100.0 * (CASE WHEN is_paid = 'yes'THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/COUNT(video_name),1) OVER(PARTITION BY video_name) AS percentage_paid
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(video_name) DESC) AS video_count
    
 FROM
    top_customer_videos
 WHERE
    video_count <= 20
 GROUP BY
    video_name
