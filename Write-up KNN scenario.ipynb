We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below."

    "\n",
    "KNN could be useful in predicting people's likeihood of paying their bills on time by identifying people in a training data set who's spending habits are most similar (using a euclidean measure of distance) and assigning a category that represents the highest proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN's ability to predict based on probability is useful in this case because it combines the different spending habits into a single feature measure of distance from the point of interest. The different categories share a single unit of measure (currency) so it would not likely need to be normalized. \n",
