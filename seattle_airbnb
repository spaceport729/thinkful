-- What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?
  It is least expensive to travel to Seattle in January after the New Year (1/4 through the beginning of February)
  I assumed the busy time of year had the least availability - that also turned out to be January. I think this may be that less people
  make their places available during those months. Is there another way to answer this?
